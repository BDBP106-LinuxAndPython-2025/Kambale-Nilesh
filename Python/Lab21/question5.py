# (5) Write a function that takes two numbers n1 and n2 and an operator description such
# as add, subtract etc. Depending on the operation, perform the operation. Raise a
# ValueError if the operator is not an arithmetic operation such as add, subtract, mul-
# tiplication or division. Catch the ValueError and ZeroDivisionError and print the
# appropriate messages. In the finally block, print a completion message. Call this func-
# tion with different scenarios to test the above exceptions. Take screenshots of the output
# while uploading your labs to GitHub.
