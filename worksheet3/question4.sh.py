# #(4)One can use sets or lists or tuples as values in a dictionary. For example, letâ€™s define the
# following dictionary
# studentmarks={
# "Rahul":{49,58, 35,64}, "Sandeep":{80,92,94,83},"Sita":{44,65,76,54}}
# Write a script to check and print the name of the student if the student has scored above
# 60 in all subjects.
studentmarks={ "Rahul":{49,58, 35,64}, "Sandeep":{80,92,94,83},"Sita":{44,65,76,54}}
for key,value in studentmarks.items():
    b=[]
    for i in value:

        if i > 60:
            b.append(i)

    if len(b) >= 4:
        print(key)
